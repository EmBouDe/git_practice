Hello Git and GitHub
This is a test repository for learning purposes. I am currently learning programming and using Git & GitHub, so this is the place where I practice the notions learnt.
The first project I started working on is a website to list the data about my books, movies and music collections. I am using HTML and later on will be using CSS and JavaScript.
I know it's very basic but I am starting to learn from scratch, so to me it's pretty cool. :)
